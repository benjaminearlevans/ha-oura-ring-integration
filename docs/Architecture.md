High‑Level Architecture

Here’s how the integration could be structured in Home Assistant:

Integration Setup / Configuration Flow

Use a config flow (UI) to allow user to input credentials: Personal Access Token or OAuth2 client credentials.

If using OAuth2: handle authorization, token refresh etc.

Data Fetching / Update Coordinator

Use DataUpdateCoordinator to periodically fetch data from Oura endpoints.

Support configurable refresh interval (e.g. hourly, every few hours, once/day for sleep etc.).

Sensors / Entities

For each type of data (activity, sleep, readiness, user profile, etc.), define one or more sensor entities.

Entities have state + rich attributes (for example, sleep sensor with total sleep, REM, deep, light, etc., with timestamps).

Dashboard / Lovelace Cards

Create a dashboard (Lovelace view) that displays key metrics: recent sleep, readiness, activity summary, etc.

Use custom cards (e.g. apexcharts-card) for trends.

Maybe combine with template sensors to derive additional values.

Handling Rate Limits / Errors

Respect Oura API limits.

Graceful handling when data missing / ring not synced.
